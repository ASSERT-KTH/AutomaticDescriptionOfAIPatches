In this difference file, the import statement for "ResponseHeadersVerbosity.NONE" has been added to the top of the file. Additionally, the condition for adding response headers has been changed. Previously, it checked if the response headers were set to "VERBOSE" using the ".equals()" method. Now, it checks if the response headers are NOT set to "NONE" using the "!NONE.equals()" method.
