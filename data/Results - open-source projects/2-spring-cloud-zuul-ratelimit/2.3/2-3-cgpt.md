This is a test file for a Spring Boot application that uses Redis for rate limiting. The changes made to the file include the addition of an import statement for org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach, which is used to annotate the resetStorage() method. This method is called before each test case and deletes all keys in the Redis instance. Additionally, a new field redisTemplate is added and autowired to allow access to the Redis instance.
