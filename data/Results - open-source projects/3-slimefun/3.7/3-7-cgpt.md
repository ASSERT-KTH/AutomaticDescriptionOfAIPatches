This is a code snippet for a class called KnowledgeFlask, which extends SimpleSlimefunItem<ItemUseHandler>. In the getItemHandler() method, the code has been modified to add a line that cancels the event using the "cancel()" method. Previously, the "e.cancel()" method was called inside the if statement but has been moved to just after the method declaration. The code inside the if statement remains unchanged.
