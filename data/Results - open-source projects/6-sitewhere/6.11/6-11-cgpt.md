This is a patch for a Java class that handles batch command invocations for devices. It adds an import statement for IDeviceType and modifies the BatchCommandInvocationHandler class to include the device type name in the error message when an invalid command token is referenced. This should make it easier to identify which device type the command token belongs to when troubleshooting.
