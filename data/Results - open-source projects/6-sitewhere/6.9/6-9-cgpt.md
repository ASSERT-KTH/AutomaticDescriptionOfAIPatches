The method assertDeviceStream has been commented out and is no longer in use. Instead, the createDateRangeSearchCriteria method has been added to create a date range search criteria based on the given parameters page, pageSize, startDate, and endDate. The method parses the start and end dates and returns a DateRangeSearchCriteria object that contains the parsed dates and the pagination information. The method also includes default values for the start and end dates if they are not provided.
