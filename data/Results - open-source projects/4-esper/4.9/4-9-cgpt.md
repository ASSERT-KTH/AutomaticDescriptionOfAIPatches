The changes made to this file involve replacing the call to EPServiceProviderManager.getProvider() with EPServiceProviderManager.getDefaultProvider(). The former method was used to retrieve a provider instance with a specific name, but the latter returns the default provider instance. The provider configuration object is passed as a parameter to the getDefaultProvider() method call.
