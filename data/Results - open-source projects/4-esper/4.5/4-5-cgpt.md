This is a file containing Java code that uses the Esper framework for event processing. The changes made to the code involve importing the class ExprNodeUtility, which provides a method toExpressionStringMinPrecedenceSafe() that converts an expression node to a string representation with minimum operator precedence. This method is then used to convert an expression node to a string before concatenating it with other strings to create a final expression string. The purpose of this change is to ensure that the resulting expression string is properly formatted and contains the correct operator precedence, which can help prevent errors and improve readability.
