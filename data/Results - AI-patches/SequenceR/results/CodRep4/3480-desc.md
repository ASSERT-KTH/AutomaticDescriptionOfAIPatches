There has been a change in the condition of an if statement, in the section of code starting on line nr 306.
  
The change is in an if clause, in a synchronized method, in the method ```getUnsafeByteBufferAddress```, in the class ```BufferUtils```.
  
The following changes have been made:  
Inserted unary operator ```!com.badlogic.gdx.utils.BufferUtils.unsafeBuffers.contains(buffer, true)``` on line 306.  
Moved invocation ```contains``` from line 306 to line 306.
